# 🚀 Railway Deployment Fix

## ❌ **Problem:** 
Railway deployment failing with "Error creating build plan with Railpack"

## ✅ **Solution:**

### **Step 1: Delete Current Railway Project**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Delete the current failed project
3. Start fresh

### **Step 2: Create New Railway Project**
1. **Go to:** https://railway.app
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Choose:** `KushaalNayak/CollegeManagementSystem`
5. **Select `backend` folder**

### **Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database**
1. **Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"**
2. **Railway will provide connection string automatically**

### **Step 4: Configure Environment Variables**
In Railway dashboard, add these variables:
- `JWT_SECRET`: `mySecretKey123456789012345678901234567890`
- `DB_USERNAME`: `postgres`
- `DB_PASSWORD`: `your-database-password`

### **Step 5: Deploy**
Railway will now use the Dockerfile and deploy successfully!

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

1. **Created Dockerfile** for proper containerization
2. **Updated application.yml** to use PostgreSQL and environment variables
3. **Added railway.json** for Railway configuration
4. **Changed from MySQL to PostgreSQL** (Railway's default)

## 🎯 **After Successful Deployment:**

- **Backend URL:** `https://your-app.railway.app/api`
- **Swagger:** `https://your-app.railway.app/api/swagger-ui.html`

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Deploy backend** to Railway (follow steps above)
2. **Get backend URL** from Railway
3. **Deploy frontend** to Vercel with backend URL
4. **Your app will be live!**

**The deployment should work now!** 🎉
