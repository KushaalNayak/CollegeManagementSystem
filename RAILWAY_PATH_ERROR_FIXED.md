# 🔧 Railway Docker Path Error - FIXED!

## ❌ **The Problem:**
Railway was looking for files in the wrong location:
- **Error:** `"/src": not found`
- **Cause:** Railway builds from root, but Dockerfile expected files in current directory

## ✅ **The Fix:**
Updated Dockerfile to use correct paths:
- **Before:** `COPY pom.xml .` and `COPY src ./src`
- **After:** `COPY backend/pom.xml .` and `COPY backend/src ./src`
